The project aims to recognise and read number plates from vehicles using the simplest model possible. The practical applications of license plate recognition can be manifold and can be efficiently accomplished by using several fucntions and modules offered by Python ML libraries. But the project is to make a model without depending on these libraries but using basic logic and mathematical understanding of how a predictive model works.
